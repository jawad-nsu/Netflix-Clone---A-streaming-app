A Netflix - Clone

1. I've made the streaming part of the web app using express.js 
which is a framework of Node.js. This express.js server will fetch
data from the videoPath (either local machine or cloud), then send
it to our frontend. 

2. The html, css has been made to renote with the real netflix as 
much as possible

3. Inside the .js file, make sure to set your VideoFile Path.
